## Usage

### Accessing the Onboarding

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/onboarding`

### Integrating with Your App

1. **Redirect New Users to Onboarding:**
   ```ruby
   # In your ApplicationController or after user signup
   redirect_to onboarding_path unless session[:onboarding_completed]
   ```

2. **Set Root Path (Optional):**
   Uncomment and set the root path in `config/routes.rb`:
   ```ruby
   root "dashboard#index"  # or your preferred landing page
   ```

   This will redirect users to your main app after completing onboarding.

3. **Customize Completion Behavior:**
   Edit `app/controllers/onboarding_controller.rb` to customize what happens after onboarding:
   ```ruby
   def complete_onboarding
     session[:onboarding_completed] = true
     # Add user preferences, send welcome email, etc.
     redirect_to your_path, notice: "Welcome!"
   end
   ```

## Testing

### Run Controller Tests
```bash
rails test test/controllers/onboarding_controller_test.rb
```

### Run System Tests
```bash
rails test:system test/system/onboarding_test.rb
```

### Run All Tests
```bash
rails test
```

## Customization

### Changing Steps
Edit `OnboardingController::STEPS` in `app/controllers/onboarding_controller.rb`:
```ruby
STEPS = %w[welcome features setup complete].freeze
```

Add corresponding partials in `app/views/onboarding/steps/`.

### Styling
- Edit `app/assets/stylesheets/onboarding.css`
- Modify CSS variables in `:root` for colors
- Adjust breakpoints for responsive design

### Content
- Edit step partials in `app/views/onboarding/steps/`
- Update text, icons, and layout as needed

### Interactions
- Modify `app/javascript/controllers/onboarding_controller.js`
- Add custom animations or behaviors

## Browser Support

- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Requires modern browser features (CSS Grid, Flexbox, ES6)

## Accessibility Features

- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys
- Focus indicators on interactive elements
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA-friendly confirm dialogs

## Next Steps

1. **Customize Content**: Update the step content to match your app's features
2. **Add Analytics**: Track onboarding completion and drop-off points
3. **User Preferences**: Store user preferences during onboarding
4. **Welcome Email**: Send a welcome email upon completion
5. **Tooltips**: Add interactive product tours on your main app

## Notes
